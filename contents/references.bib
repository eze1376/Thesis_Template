	title={Performing the Kick During Walking for RoboCup 3D Soccer Simulation League Using Reinforcement Learning Algorithm},
	journal={International Journal of Social Robotics},
	year={2020},
	month={Nov},
	day={01},
	abstract={Nowadays, humanoid soccer serves as a benchmark for artificial intelligence and robotic problems. The factors such as the kicking speed and the number of kicks by robot soccer players are the most significant aims that the participating teams are pursued in the RoboCup 3D Soccer Simulation League. The proposed method presents a kicking strategy during walking for humanoid soccer robots. Achieving an accurate and powerful kicking while robots are moving requires a dynamic optimization of the speed and motion parameters of the robot. In this paper, a curved motion path has been designed based on the robot position relative to the ball and the goal. Ultimately, the robot will be able to kick at the goal by walking along this curve path. The speed and angle of the walking robot are set towards the ball with regard to the robots curved motion path. After the final step of the robot, the accurate and effective adjustment of these two parameters ensures that the robot is located in the ideal position to perform the perfect kick. Due to the noise and walking condition of the robot, it is essential that the speed and angle of motion to be measured more accurately. For this purpose, we use a reinforcement learning model to adjust the robots step size and so does achieve the optimal value of two abovementioned parameters. Using reinforcement learning, robot would learn to pursue an optimal policy to correctly kick towards designated points. Therefore, the proposed method is a model-free and based on dynamic programming. The experiments reveal that the proposed method has significantly improved the team overall performance and robots ability to kick. Our proposed method has been 9.32{\%} successful on average and outperformed the UTAustinVilla agent in terms of goal-scoring time in a non-opponent simulator.},

This paper proposes a multimodal sensory fusion method based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for RoboCup 3D Simulation league. This approach fuses Inertia Navigation System (INS) and vision perceptor information from different sensors at feature level instead of raw data.

Reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence, is a computational approach to learning whereby an agent tries to maximize the total amount of reward it receives while interacting with a complex, uncertain environment. In Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the field's key ideas and algorithms. This second edition has been significantly expanded and updated, presenting new topics and updating coverage of other topics. Like the first edition, this second edition focuses on core online learning algorithms, with the more mathematical material set off in shaded boxes. Part I covers as much of reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond the tabular case for which exact solutions can be found. Many algorithms presented in this part are new to the second edition, including UCB, Expected Sarsa, and Double Learning. Part II extends these ideas to function approximation, with new sections on such topics as artificial neural networks and the Fourier basis, and offers expanded treatment of off-policy learning and policy-gradient methods. Part III has new chapters on reinforcement learning's relationships to psychology and neuroscience, as well as an updated case-studies chapter including AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, Atari game playing, and IBM Watson's wagering strategy. The final chapter discusses the future societal impacts of reinforcement learning.}

The proposed method adapts the exploration parameter of $\epsilon$-greedy in dependence of the temporal-difference error observed from value-function backups, which is considered as a measure of the agent's uncertainty about the environment. VDBE is evaluated on a multi-armed bandit task, which allows for insight into the behavior of the method. Preliminary results indicate that VDBE seems to be more parameter robust than commonly used ad hoc approaches such as $\epsilon$-greedy or softmax.},

Some hardware systems, such as mobile robots, operate under constrained hardware situations, but still benefit from object detection capabilities. Multiple network models have been proposed, achieving comparable accuracy with reduced architectures and leaner operations. Motivated by the need to create a near real-time object detection system for a soccer team of mobile robots operating with x86 CPU-only embedded computers, this work analyses the average precision and inference time of multiple object detection systems in a constrained hardware setting. We train open implementations of MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3 models with different underlying architectures, achieved by changing their input and width multipliers, as well as YOLOv3, TinyYOLOv3, YOLOv4 and TinyYOLOv4 in an annotated image dataset captured using a mobile robot. We emphasize the speed/accuracy trade-off in the models by reporting their average precision on a test data set and their inference time in videos at different resolutions, under constrained and unconstrained hardware configurations. Results show that MobileNetV3 models have a good trade-off between average precision and inference time in constrained scenarios only, while MobileNetV2 with high width multipliers are appropriate for server-side inference. YOLO models in their official implementations are not suitable for inference in CPUs.},
